Interactive Literature Website: Iubitorul de carti

This repository contains the source code for an interactive website developed as my final project (atestat) in 2023. The site is dedicated to literature, featuring book reviews, author profiles, and curated lists of both classic and contemporary works.

Overview
The website boasts a responsive design and interactive navigation menu with dropdowns. Initially incorporating PHP, the project has been fully migrated to client-side functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a contact form that simulates data submission by redirecting users to a "thanks.html" page.

Dynamic Navigation: Intuitive dropdown menus.

Content-Rich Pages: Dedicated sections for reviews, authors, and literary news.
